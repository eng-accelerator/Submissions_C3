What it demonstrates:
An app that lets users upload product/app designs.
Create multiple agents like
visual analysis agent
UX critique agent
market research agent.
And 
.
It shall work in Multi-Agent System with LangGraph - Created an orchestrator with 4 agents:
Task Classifier (determines what type of task it is)
Code Generator (creates the code)
Code Reviewer (validates and approves/rejects code)
File Manager (saves approved code to files)

Creative & Design Agents
Brand Consistency Agent — checks alignment with brand guidelines, colors, fonts, and tone.
Aesthetic Quality Agent — scores visual appeal, balance, and modernity of design.

🧑‍💻 Usability & Interaction Agents
Performance Agent — predicts load times, responsiveness, and mobile optimization issues.
📊 Business & Market Agents

Conversion Optimization Agent — analyzes CTAs, layout, and funnel effectiveness.
Monetization Agent — evaluates ad placement, subscription flows, or in‑app purchase UX.

🔒 Security & Compliance Agents
Privacy & Security Agent — checks for data collection transparency and secure design patterns.
Ethical Design Agent — flags dark patterns or manipulative UX choices.

🤖 AI/Automation Agents
Trend Analysis Agent — maps design choices against current UI/UX trends.

Attached is my code but use the same design and color patterns as provided in attachments for good refrence.
Also, please only code for agents provided in the promt and do not include all the agnets provided in the attached code you gave me earlier.

also - please make it efficient when i upload the file or click the "Initiate Nueral Scan" button - i need some kind of progress showing for user that action is taken once uploaded or once clicked. also some fonts are grey whith dark background - bake the font color little visible but ot should be futuristic again.
one more change is - I want the analysys results display to show in full page not just half page.
